# The Grady Game
This research project focuses on evaluating the human ability to comprehend quadratic functions, specifically in finding their minima, through numerical versus visual strategies. The application has two distinct modes: one presenting problems numerically and the other visually through graphs. The objective is to discern which method better facilitates the quick and accurate identification of a function's minimum point.

Users will use the app to identify the minima of various quadratic functions, with the time taken to achieve this recorded for both modes. This data serve as a basis for comparing the effectiveness of numerical and visual comprehension in mathematical problem-solving. The study aims to go beyond the surface of educational technology, delving into the cognitive processes that underpin our understanding of mathematics.

The implications of this research extend into educational methodology, potentially revolutionizing the way mathematical concepts are taught. By pinpointing whether a numerical or visual approach is more conducive to learning, educators could tailor their teaching to fit cognitive preferences, thus enhancing student engagement and improving overall mathematical proficiency. 

Ultimately, through an example of identifying the minima of quadratic functions, this project seeks to align educational practices with the natural ways humans process information.

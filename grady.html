      Grady is a research project by Computer Science students at
      Foothill College, Los Altos Hills, CA.<p>

      The project aims to find data to investigate how humans
      approach problems that can be tackled with analytical versus
      visual cues. This game, Grady, was developed by us to collect
      and interpret data to this end. Source code and other data for
      and from the Grady project can be found
      <a href="https://github.com/IsidorManning/grady-game">on
      Github</a><p>.

      <h2>The Research Team (Alphabetical order)</h2>

      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rebecca_b0920"
      class="name_link">Rebecca Blau</a> is a first-year CS student at
      Foothill College. She is interested in learning about how
      computer science and biology intersect. Rebecca is a hands-on
      learner, so she wants Grady to reflect on the importance of
      visual learning. She also seeks to gain experience with
      collaboration in the computer science field through this
      opportunity.<p>

      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/katelyn_d1886/"
      class="name_link">Katelyn Deng</a> is currently a Dual
      Enrollment student at Foothill College. As an enthusiastic piano
      player, she is excited to combine her knowledge of art with her
      passion for computer science in the Grady Project. Through this
      opportunity, she especially hopes to gain more hands-on
      experience in research collaboration and in writing research
      papers. Katelyn is also a piano player and is working on a set
      of sound effects for the next version of this game.<p>

      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rui_d0225"
      class="name_link">Rui Dong</a> is a CS student at Foothill
      College, and the winter of 2024 is her first quarter. Rui has
      multiple postgraduate degrees in business and has over 5
      years of experience working in the operations department of a
      tech company, where she finally found her interest in CS when her
      team tried to automate slow-moving workbooks.<p>

      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ryan_g1357"
      class="name_link">Ryan Gillies</a> is a CS student at Foothill
      College with an additional interest in debate, ethics, and
      philosophy. Having taken nearly an equal share of STEM and
      humanities classes, Ryan believes that working with and studying
      the implications of the Grady game offers an invaluable
      opportunity to utilize CS knowledge to understand the potential
      self-fulfilling effects of individual strengths and
      weaknesses.<p>

      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/rina_l108"
      class="name_link">Rina Li</a> is a CS student at Foothill
      College with an Applied Math degree from UC Berkeley. She is
      interested in the intersection of math and cognitive
      science. She sees the Grady project an opportunity for hands-on
      research in both fields.<p>

      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/isidor_m3232/"
      class="name_link">Isidor Manning</a>, Principal Investigator and
      software engineer for the Grady Project), is an international CS
      student from Sweden. While also being passionate about fields
      like physics and entrepreneurship, Isidor has always had a
      particular fascination for AI and data science. As a consequence
      of this fascination, Isidor is dedicated to developing the Grady
      game into a statistical tool, capable of unraveling the learning
      patterns exhibited by various individuals playing the Grady
      game.

      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/wesley_m2/"
      class="name_link">Wesley Miller</a> holds an MFA in studio art
      from UC Davis and is now pursuing an education in computer
      science.<p>

      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Sanatan_M_2953/"
      class="name_link">Sanatan Mishra</a> is a CS studfent at
      Foothill College. He is interested in computer science and
      wishes to use computer science and AI to make the world more
      convenient and safer.<p>

      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/ariana_y7"
      class="name_link">Ariana Yi</a> is a dual enrollment student at
      Foothill College. She is interested in computer science and
      mathematics, hoping to major in both of these fields in the
      future. She aspires to be a professor, inspiring and guiding
      others to learn. As an artist who learns best from the
      visualization of concepts, she hopes to use her background in
      both arts and STEM to contribute to the Grady Project, which
      encourages engaging and effective visual learning.<p>

      <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/cindy_z333/"
      class="name_link" href="">Cindy Zhao</a> is studying CS at
      Foothill/UCSB. Growing up, she found STEM concepts difficult to
      grasp without proper visual aids. With the Grady project, she
      hopes to develop recommendations for mathematics instruction to
      improve general math literacy. She's also interested in
      researching emergent AI behavior and finding answers at the
      intersection of tech and the humanities.<p>

      The Grady Research report will be available [here] when it is released.<p>

      <h2>Easter Eggs/Tips for Grady</h2>
      <ul>
	<li>Toggle the difficulty level by changing “level” in the url:
	"index.html?level=1". Level 1 is default. Currently acceptable
	levels are 1, 2 and 3, which require increasing precision in the
	input guesses. Here are links for <a href="index.html?level=2">level 2</a>
	and <a href="index.html?level=3">level 3</a> if you you're feeling lazy.</li>

	<li>In visual mode, you can zoom in on <strong>only the y-axis</strong> by hovering your cursor over it
	  and using your scroll wheel to zoom.</li>

	<li>Getting too tough? End the game early by entering <i>I give up</i>.</li>
      </ul><p>
